🏠 Smart Rent & Utility Manager (PropTech)
The Problem: Rental management in Kenya often relies on manual tracking and WhatsApp messages, leading to "lost" payments, utility billing errors, and messy ledger books.

The Solution: A full-stack Django platform that centralizes property management. By integrating M-Pesa STK Push and automated utility calculations, it creates a transparent, automated financial ecosystem for property owners.

🚀 Key Features
Automated STK Push: One-click or scheduled payment requests sent directly to tenants' phones.

Instant Digital Receipts: Automated PDF generation and email delivery upon successful mpesa_callback.

Utility Dashboard: Smart input for water/electricity meter readings with automatic bill calculation.

Payment History: Transparent, real-time ledger for both landlords and tenants.
